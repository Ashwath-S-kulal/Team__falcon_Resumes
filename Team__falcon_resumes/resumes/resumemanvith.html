        <li><strong>Project 1:Personal library management system</strong>
          I developed a library management system for my personal book collection. 
          The interface allows you to enter book information, including title, author, ISBN, publisher and publication date.
           You can also perform searches by title, author or date.</li>
        <li><strong>Project 2:Warehouse management system</strong>I worked on the development team for a warehouse management system that included receiving, shipping, billing, reporting and administration modules.
           The system helped users keep track of inventory as it entered and moved through the warehouse and provided reports in both PDF and spreadsheet formats based on selected criteria. </li>
